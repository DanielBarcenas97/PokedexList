# PokedexList

This project is a simple example of implementing recyclerview with data persistence with room.
In this mini project we can add pokemons to a list where we fill in elements such as name, ability, date of capture and type of pokemon.
We can also know how many Pok√©mon we have captured and we can also filter the list by date with a calendar.
